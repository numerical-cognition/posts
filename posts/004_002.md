Primer for getting started with Docker. Primer is written primarily for linux/mac, and provides some of the most common commands required to get your Docker set-up going. 

## What is Docker?

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications.

## Why use Docker?

Docker allows developers to work in standardized environments using [containers](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#docker-objects). What this essentially means is that "“Dockerized” apps are completely portable and can run anywhere, on any system, without the need to configure and set-up your enviroment.

## Docker Architecture

Docker uses a [client-server architecture](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#docker-architecture). The Docker *client* (aka. Docker CLI) talks to the Docker *daemon*, which does the heavy lifting of building, running, and distributing your Docker containers.

![Edit This](docs/images/docker-architecture.svg)

### Docker client

The Docker *client* (`docker`) is the primary way to interact with Docker. When you use commands such as `docker run`, the client sends these commands to the docker *daemon* (`dockerd`), which carries them out. 

### Docker daemon

The Docker *daemon* (`dockerd`) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. A daemon can also communicate with other daemons to manage Docker services.

### Docker registry

A Docker *registry* stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker is configured to look for images on Docker Hub by default. You can even run your own private registry.

## Instalation requirements

### Linux

The 3.10.x kernel is [the minimum requirement](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/binaries/#check-kernel-dependencies) for Docker.

### MacOS

10.8 “Mountain Lion” or newer is required.

### Windows 10

Hyper-V must be enabled in BIOS

VT-D must also be enabled if available (Intel Processors). 

## Installation

If you are a complete Docker newbie, you should probably follow the [tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/engine/getstarted/) for your operating system.

### Linux

Run this quick and easy install script provided by Docker:

```sh
$ curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```

If you don't want to run a random shell script, please see the [installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/) instructions for your distribution.

### macOS

If you have Homebrew-Cask, type in your terminal:

```sh
$ brew cask install docker
```

Alternativley, you can download and install [Docker Community Edition](https://www.docker.com/community-edition). 

Once you've installed Docker Community Edition, click the docker icon in Launchpad. Then start up a container by typing:

```sh
$ docker run hello-world
```

That's it, you now have a running Docker container.

### Windows 10

Official instructions to install Docker Desktop for Windows can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows).

> If you're using windows, please check out a more detailed explanation I've written for you [here](docs/examples/windows.md).

Once installed, open powershell as administrator and run:

```sh
# Display the version of docker installed:
$ docker version

# Pull, create, and run 'hello-world' container:
$ docker run hello-world
```

That's it, you now have a running Docker container.

## Using Docker 

### Check Version

It is very important that you always know the current version of Docker you are currently running on at any point in time.

* [`docker version`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/version/) shows which version of docker you have running.

Get detailed information about your version (client and server) by running:

```sh
$ docker version
# Output will be detailed information about your docker version
```

Get only the version:

```sh
$ docker version --format '{{.Server.Version}}'
# 1.8.0
```

## Most common Docker commands

These are some of the most common commands while using Docker. All of them link to Docker documentation page where you can see examples of usage.

> I have also made a folder with all of my saved commands and examples. Check it out [here](docs/examples).

## Container commands

A [Container](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#docker-objects) is a runnable instance of an image. And an [image](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/#docker-objects) is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container.

> To see some of my own container related examples and saved commands, go [here](docs/examples/commands_container.md).

### Lifecycle

* [`docker create`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/create) creates a container but does not start it.

* [`docker tag`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag) tags an image to a name (local or registry).

## Network commands

Docker has a [networks](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/) feature that automatically creates 3 network interfaces when you create a container (bridge, host, none).

> To read a bit more about it and see some of my own examples and saved commands, go [here](docs/examples/commands_network.md).


### Lifecycle

* [`docker network create`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network_create/) Create a new network (default type: bridge).
* [`docker network rm`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network_rm/) Remove one or more networks by name or identifier. No containers can be connected to the network when deleting it.

* [`docker network disconnect`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/network_disconnect/) Disconnect a container from a network


## Volumes commands

Docker [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/) are are files and folders that can be attached to containers (or perserved from within the container).

> To read a bit more about it and see some of my own volumes related examples and saved commands, go [here](docs/examples/commands_volumes.md).

### Lifecycle

* [`docker volume inspect`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/volume_inspect/)


## Registry commands

A repository is a *hosted* collection of tagged images that together create the file system for a container.

A registry is a *host* -- a server that stores repositories and provides an HTTP API for [managing the uploading and downloading of repositories](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockerrepos/).

Docker.com hosts its own [index](https://hub.docker.com/) to a central registry which contains a large number of repositories.  Having said that, the central docker registry [does not do a good job of verifying images](https://titanous.com/posts/docker-insecurity) and should be avoided if you're worried about security.

* [`docker login`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login) to login to a registry.
* [`docker logout`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logout) to logout from a registry.
* [`docker search`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/search) searches registry for image.
* [`docker pull`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull) pulls an image from registry to local machine.
* [`docker push`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/push) pushes an image to the registry from local machine.


## Dockerfile

[The configuration file](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/). Sets up a Docker container when you run `docker build` on it. Vastly preferable to `docker commit`.  

### Dockerfile commands

* [.dockerignore](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file) defines which files and folders should be avoided while building a docker image.
* [FROM](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from) sets the Base Image for subsequent instructions.
* [RUN](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run) execute any commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results.
* [CMD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) provide defaults for an executing container.
* [EXPOSE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#expose) informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime.  NOTE: does not actually make ports accessible.
* [ENV](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#env) sets environment variable.
* [ADD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#add) copies new files, directories or remote file to container.  Invalidates caches. Avoid `ADD` and use `COPY` instead.
* [COPY](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy) copies new files or directories to container.  By default this copies as root regardless of the USER/WORKDIR settings.  Use `--chown=<user>:<group>` to give ownership to another user/group.  (Same for `ADD`.)
* [ENTRYPOINT](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#entrypoint) configures a container that will run as an executable.
* [VOLUME](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#volume) creates a mount point for externally mounted volumes or other containers.
* [USER](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#user) sets the user name for following RUN / CMD / ENTRYPOINT commands.
* [WORKDIR](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#workdir) sets the working directory.
* [ARG](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg) defines a build-time variable.
* [ONBUILD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#onbuild) adds a trigger instruction when the image is used as the base for another build.
* [STOPSIGNAL](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#stopsignal) sets the system call signal that will be sent to the container to exit.
* [LABEL](https://docs.docker.com/config/labels-custom-metadata/) apply key/value metadata to your images, containers, or daemons.
* [SHELL](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#shell) override default shell is used by docker to run commands.
* [HEALTHCHECK](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck) tells docker how to test a container to check that it is still working.

## Layers

The versioned filesystem in Docker is based on layers. They're like [git commits or changesets for filesystems](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/storagedriver/imagesandcontainers/).

## Links

Links are how Docker containers talk to each other [through TCP/IP ports](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/default_network/dockerlinks/).

> To read a bit more about it and see some of my own links related examples and saved commands, go [here](docs/examples/commands_links.md).

## Exposing ports

Exposing incoming ports through the host container is [fiddly but doable](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#expose-incoming-ports).

> To read a bit more about it and see some of my own examples and saved commands, go [here](docs/examples/commands_ports.md).

## Security

The Docker [security](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/) page goes into much more detail.

> To read a bit more about it and see some of my own (shorter) explanations, go [here](docs/examples/commands_security.md).

## Docker-Compose

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. To learn more about all the features of Compose, see the [list of features](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/#features).
